## BUG-0002 — base64 helper read past its buffer on the short final group
- found:     2026-08-23
- status:    fixed
- class:     memory
- where:     tests/cooker_test.cpp
- symptom:   stack-buffer-overflow, plus a UBSan "index 80 out of bounds for type 'unsigned char[80]'"
- cause:     80 % 3 == 2, so the last base64 group has two bytes, but the loop read `buf[i+1]` and `buf[i+2]` unconditionally. It also encoded a character derived from stack garbage, and round-tripped only because the decoder discards that byte as padding.
- pinned-by: tests/cooker_test.cpp
- lane:      asan
- proof:     ASan and UBSan both report at the exact line without the bounds check.
