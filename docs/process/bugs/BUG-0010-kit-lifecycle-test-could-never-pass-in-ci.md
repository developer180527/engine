## BUG-0010 — kit_lifecycle_test could never pass in CI
- found:     2026-08-23
- status:    fixed
- class:     coverage
- where:     tests/CMakeLists.txt
- symptom:   a permanently-failing test in the `unit` lane.
- cause:     the test registered whenever `fps_shooter/project.json` existed — which is committed — but its actual fixture is a kit module built from a separate gitignored repo. It never mattered because CI ran only the docs lane, and would have made the first gating lane worthless.
- pinned-by: tests/CMakeLists.txt
- lane:      unit
- proof:     the guard now requires the kit module itself; configure prints a STATUS line naming what is missing, and all three lanes report 100%.
