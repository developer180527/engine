## BUG-0001 — UndoStack::push computed an iterator before begin()
- found:     2026-08-23
- status:    fixed
- class:     memory
- where:     src/editor/undo_stack.h
- symptom:   heap-buffer-overflow, 8-byte read before the deque's block map
- cause:     `begin() + m_index + 1` parses as `(begin() + m_index) + 1`, and m_index is -1 once everything has been undone. A deque iterator computes eagerly, so `operator+=` walked the block-pointer map on the spot. The final value was correct, which is why it never produced a wrong answer.
- pinned-by: tests/editor_undo_test.cpp
- lane:      asan
- proof:     the existing test already exercised the path and had been passing for weeks; it fails under ASan without the parentheses and passes with them.
