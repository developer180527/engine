## BUG-0009 — GLFW was linked into every build, including SDL3 ones
- found:     2026-08-23
- status:    fixed
- class:     build
- where:     src/runtime/input/input_system.h
- symptom:   an SDL3 build linked GLFW; a host supplying its own window dragged in a windowing library it had no use for.
- cause:     input_system.h included `<GLFW/glfw3.h>` and branched on the backend in six places. Because input.h, input_map.h, input_sources.h, runtime.cpp and the editor all include it, one include decided the link line for the whole engine.
- pinned-by: src/CMakeLists.txt
- lane:      unit
- proof:     stashed the change and reconfigured — `libglfw3.a` is in the SDL3 `engine_player` link line before and absent after. NOT YET A TEST: this is verified by hand, and BUG-0009 is the reason the `build` class exists. See the open item below.
